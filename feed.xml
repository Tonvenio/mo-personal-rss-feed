<title>Why Gen X is the real loser generation</title>
<description>Move over, millennials. Zip it, Gen Z. Those age groups, according to our number crunchers, are relative winners among the generations. The crushed cohort, apparently, is my own. On multiple fronts, Gen Xers are the losers. Those of us born between 1965 and 1980 are not only neglected (almost nobody bothers making memes or podcasts about our generation), we're also beleaguered, stuck in the U-bend of life, likely to be caring for needy kids and parents at the same time. We have also, on average, done a notably poor job over the decades of nudging up our salaries. We've squandered, or lacked, opportunities to accumulate wealth, including houses.</description>

      <title>♾️ Welcome to Human in the Loop</title>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Thanks for joining Human in the Loop. I'm Andreas — and I'm genuinely excited you're here.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Let's get straight to it. I'm here to do 3 things for you:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sense of AI agents and current GenAI innovation</li>
          <li>Drop curated tools and real-world use cases</li>
          <li>Tactical career advice so you can grow fast in an AI-first world</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Why I started this</h2>
        
        <p>Everyone has an opinion on AI. Some say it's overhyped. Others call it the fourth industrial revolution. I'm not here for the noise — I'm here for the response.</p>
        
        <p>Because whether you're an optimist or a skeptic, the tech is already here — reshaping how we live, work, and make decisions.</p>
        
        <p>In this moment, you can either be the <strong>driver</strong> — or the <strong>passenger</strong>. Drivers set the direction. Passengers follow. And right now, while the tools are still early and the rules are still forming, you have a rare chance to lead. Those who choose to engage now — who experiment, iterate, and learn — will shape what comes next.</p>
        
        <p>That's why I created Human in the Loop — to make sure you're the driver.</p>
        
        <h3>IMPORTANT — Next steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Reply to this email with a quick "Yes".</li>

        <p><strong>Welcome to the loop and excited to have you here.</strong></p>
        
        <p>See you soon!</p>
        
        <p>— Andreas</p>
        
        <p><strong>P.S. I read every reply — if there's something you want me to cover or share your thoughts on, just let me know!</strong></p>
